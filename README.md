# UGM-Database
Database for the Union Gospel Mission

This database system is based on the Django framework 
(https://www.djangoproject.com/) and designed to be run on a Debian based
Linux system (https://www.debian.org/).  The installation instructions
assume you have already setup a working Debian environment.  If you want
a windows based system, visit [comming soon] for a prebuilt diskimage
you can run in VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/), step-by-step 
setup instructions, written/video tutorials on using the database, and
reporting system examples and templates.

Thanks for your interest in the UGM-Database.
