The database is divided into three broad categories
 - Framework (the actual django program)
 - Content (forms, fields, permissions, reports, &c from the user)
 - Data (values of the fields created by the content level)


Permissions are divided among these categories.  

Framework permissions reside with whoever can change/update the program

Framework level Content permissions are managed by the django framework.  
These permissions are set per user through the Admin area of the 
framework and include the ability to create new content, view current 
content, edit previous content, and delete content.

Content level Content permissions are divided into two categories, read
and write.

Content level Content Read permissions are handled by the framework 
through the creation of "permissions" content.  Content itself is then 
assigned "May Have"  content permissions, which allow read access to 
content if *any* of the permissions are satisfied, and "Must Have" 
content permissions, which allow read access to content if *all* the 
permissions are satisfied.

Content level Content Write permissions are further divided into two 
categories, Framework level Content Creation, managed by the framework 
as mentioned previously, and Content level Content Modification, which 
restricts content modification to content owners.

Data level permissions consist of read and write permissions.  Read
permissions are managed in like manner to content level permissions.
Framework level Data permissions are managed through Django to allow
users to view, create, alter, and delete Data.  Content level Data 
permissions are managed by reference to the user's Content level Content
permissions.
